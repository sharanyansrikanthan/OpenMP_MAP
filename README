This directory contains the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) along 
with the necessary changes required for OpenMP to interact with 
MAPPER [1] (repo found here: https://github.com/sharanyansrikanthan/SAM-MAP)

For configuring and compiling instructions, look below. 

The GNU Compiler Collection is free software.  See the files whose
names start with COPYING for copying permission.  The manuals, and
some of the runtime libraries, are under different terms; see the
individual source files for details.

The directory INSTALL contains copies of the installation information
as HTML and plain text.  The source of this information is
gcc/doc/install.texi.  The installation information includes details
of what is included in the GCC sources and what files GCC installs.

See the file gcc/doc/gcc.texi (together with other files that it
includes) for usage and porting information.  An online readable
version of the manual is in the files gcc/doc/gcc.info*.

See http://gcc.gnu.org/bugs/ for how to report bugs usefully.

Copyright years on GCC source files may be listed using range
notation, e.g., 1987-2012, indicating that every year in the range,
inclusive, is a copyrightable year that could otherwise be listed
individually.

Configuring: 

OpenMP integrated with MAPPER is build on top of the GCC compiler.
All the configuration options available to compile GCC are available
with this package also. The configuration parameters used to build the
system is 

./configure --prefix=<path for build> --enable-languages=c,c++,fortran 
--disable-multilib --disable-bootstrap --with-system-zlib

Building: 

The build was performed using: 
sudo make -j <number of cores>
sudo make DESTDIR=<path for installation> install

For compiling applictions, include the following:
-fopenmp -static -L/<path of installation>/usr/local/lib64/libgomp -lgomp -lrt
